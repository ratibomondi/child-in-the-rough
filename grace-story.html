      <p><strong>“She wants to bake bread. All she needs is a way to rise.”</strong></p>

      <p>
        Grace is only 9, but her dreams are as warm and full as the loaves she hopes to bake someday...
      </p>

      <div class="grace-highlight">
        Just <strong>$500</strong> is needed to fund Grace’s school year.
      </div>

      <div class="grace-progress">
        <div class="grace-progress-bar">60% funded</div>
      </div>

      <p>You can give Grace a recipe for a brighter life — and be the reason she rises.</p>
