      <h2>David's Story</h2>

      <p><strong>“No child should suffer in silence when we can help.”</strong></p>

      <p>
        This is an <strong>urgent fundraising appeal</strong> for <strong>David</strong>, a young student who is suffering from both physical and emotional trauma. 
        He initially spent nearly a month in the hospital after sustaining <strong>extensive burns that covered over half his body</strong>. 
        While undergoing treatment, doctors discovered a painful and rapidly growing mass on his ear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite the initial hospital stay, the <strong>growth has continued to enlarge</strong> and cause severe discomfort. 
        A second hospital consultation has revealed that David now requires <strong>surgery to remove the upper portion of his ear</strong>. 
        Without it, the growth will continue to expand, making the situation worse and more costly.

      <div class="david-highlight">
        We are urgently trying to raise <strong>$1100</strong> to cover David’s surgery and aftercare. Every donation, no matter how small, brings him closer to healing.

      <p>
        David has already suffered more than any child should. He deserves a chance to live, learn, and grow without pain.
